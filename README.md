Computational experiment with Lyndon and Lempel-Ziv factorizations

*A coursework under the direction of Professor Arseny M. Shur.*

Objective
---------

Let *Z(S)* be the number of factors in Lempel-Ziv factorization of the string, *L(S)* be the number of *different* factors in Lyndon factorization of the string. Here's a hypothesis:

*L(S) = O( Z(S) )*

Only one series of strings where *L(S) > Z(S)* was known. The objective of this work is to find more series with this property.

Description of the results is available [in Russian](paper/paper.pdf).
